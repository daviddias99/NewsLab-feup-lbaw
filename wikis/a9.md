# A9: Product (Collaborative News)

Our product is called NewsLab. It consists of a collaborative news web application where anyone has the freedom to write and develop news about various topics and read about occurrences all around the world, serving as a platform not only to increase each one's awareness and knowledge about the world but also as a way to unite people and increase communication. It will be designed to create an all-encompassing place where people can write and discuss news in a collaborative manner, centralizing news and perspectives from all over the world allowing users to create a wholesome outlook on whatever subject they like.

This artifact is the final display of our work in this project. In it, we describe what is needed to install and run the platform, providing with it the credentials to some working accounts. The following sections provide information on the validity of the implemented solution in terms of usability, accessibility, and code validation. We end by describing the used libraries and giving a general overview of the implemented features.

## 3. Main features

Our platform supports the main features needed for **publishing** and **reading** news. We also want to promote discussion and feedback, as such, we also allow **commenting** on posts, replying to comments, and **ratings** (like or dislike) both on posts and comments. The user may also **save posts** that he wishes to read later on and may **subscribe** to users and tags so that he stays updated on the current events. The platform's users may **search** for posts using several criteria such as the post's rating, publication date, etc.. On a user's **profile** he may check it's comments, posts, likes, statistics, as well as the **badges** that he has already earned. These badges are an incentive for users to do good contributions to the platform. On the administration side of the website, users have the possibility to **ban other users**, **review reports** that have been made by other users, and **delete inappropriate content**.

## 4. Application Help

We think that the design of our platform is intuitive and that the main actions of reading/creating posts can be done in a straightforward manner. However, we implemented help in places that we saw fit, such as marking the current page in the menu so that a user always knows it's location (for example if a user is in the "News" page, the "News" link in the navbar has a marker). Also when creating a post we provided feedback for incorrect and obligatory form elements. Additionally, we've included floating cards throughout the platform, that provide feedback to the user about errors or the success of actions he performed (this can be seen upon publishing a comment or reporting a user).

## 5. Input Validation

Input data was validated in two settings. One was done at a user-level using HTML attributes. An example of this can be seen in the input element for a post's title:

```
<input class="form-control rounded-0 text-dark" id="titleInput" placeholder="Choose one title" required pattern="[A-Za-z0-9?+*_!#$%,\/;.&\s-]{3,100}" title="Title must have between 3 and 100 letters, numbers or symbols like ?+*_!#$%,\/;.&-">
```

However, since these methods can be easily bypassed and because we offer an extensive API, input data is also validated on the server-side, using PHP functions and Laravel's built-in validator class. An example of this can be seen on the function create of the PostController, which handles the post creation endpoint (api/posts) 
```
        $validator = Validator::make($request->all(),
            [
                'type' => [
                    'required',
                    'string',
                    Rule::in(['News', 'Opinion']),
                ],
                'tags' => 'required|string|ntags:2|nodups',
                'title' => 'required|string|min:3',
                'body' => 'required|string|min:10',
                'photo' => 'required|image|mimes:jpg,jpeg,bmp,png|max:10000',
                'date' => 'nullable|date|after_or_equal:today',
                'hasNewFile' => Rule::in(['yes'])
            ], 
            [
                'tags.required' => "Tags cannot not be empty",
                "tags.string" => "Invalid tags",
                "tags.ntags" => "You must have 1 or 2 tags",
                "tags.nodups" => "You have duplicate tags",
                'title.required' => "Title cannot not be empty",
                "title.string" => "Invalid title",
                "title.min" => "Title too short (must be at least 3 characters long).",
                'body.required' => "Body cannot not be empty",
                "body.string" => "Invalid body",
                "body.min" => "Body too short (must be at least 10 characters long).",
                'photo.required' => "The post needs to have an image",
                "photo.mimes" => "Photo has to be either a jpeg, jpg, bmp or png",
                "photo.image" => "Photo has to be either a jpeg, jpg, bmp or png",
                "photo.max" => "Photo is too big (max size is 10 MB)",
            ]
        );
```

## 6. Check Accessibility and Usability

The results of the accessibility and usability tests are:
* Accessibility: 14/18
* Usability: 23/28

## 7. HTML & CSS Validation

All HTML and CSS was validated with these online validators:
* HTML: https://validator.w3.org/nu/  
* CSS: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/  

No pages present any errors. However, the CSS validation presents some errors pertaining to the usage of CSS variables and the usage of vendor-specific styles.


## 8. Revisions to the Project

Since the requirement stage of the project we've not added new user stories, however, we've changed the priority of some of them since we came to the conclusion that they weren't as essential to the project:

| US | Old priority | New priority |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| US602 | Important | Optional |
| US603 | Important | Optional |
| US604 | Important | Optional |

During development, we've also added and updated some of the endpoints described in A7

## 9. Implementation Details

### 9.1. Libraries Used

#### EasyMDE ([link](https://easymde.tk/))

We use this library in order to allow for the usage of Markdown in our posts. We also used it in order to convert the markdown created by the user into HTML code that may be displayed. An example of its usage can be seen in the "edit_post.js" file and you can try it [here](http://lbaw2022.lbaw-prod.fe.up.pt/posts/create).

#### DOMPurify ([link](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify))

This library is used to sanitize HTML and to prevent XSS attacks. An example of its usage can be seen in the "edit_post.js" file.

#### Tempus Dominus ([link](https://tempusdominus.github.io/bootstrap-4/))

We use this library to provided Boostrap-compatible calendars, in order to schedule bans and publications. These calendars support extra features that allow us to customize the type of input (date format and to prevent the choice of certain dates). An example of its usage can be seen in the "edit_post.js" file and you can try it [here](http://lbaw2022.lbaw-prod.fe.up.pt/posts/create).

#### Revisited jQuery TagsInput ([link](https://github.com/underovsky/jquery-tagsinput-revisited))

This library is used to provide an intuitive and appealing interface for inputting the tags of our posts. An example of its usage can be seen in the "tags.js" file and you can try it [here](http://lbaw2022.lbaw-prod.fe.up.pt/posts/create).

#### noUiSlider - JavaScript Range Slider ([link](https://refreshless.com/nouislider/))

We utilize this library to have numerical sliders that can choose both a bottom and top bound. This provided and intuitive and easy way to input a numerical interval, which we use to filter posts by its rating, for example. An example of its usage can be seen in the "filter.js" file and you can try it [here](http://lbaw2022.lbaw-prod.fe.up.pt/posts/search?search=cunha). 

#### Chart.js ([link](https://www.chartjs.org/))

This library is used in order to display colorful and appealing charts to the user. In particular, we use it to display user statistics. An example of its usage can be seen in the "stats.js" or "pie_chart.js" and you can try it [here](http://lbaw2022.lbaw-prod.fe.up.pt/users/6).  

#### Font Awesome ([link](https://fontawesome.com/))

We use this library in order to obtain a wide range of icons that we use throughout the platform. An example of its usage is the calendar icon which you can see when you [create a post](http://lbaw2022.lbaw-prod.fe.up.pt/posts/create).

#### Carbon ([link](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/))

Carbon is used to parse dates, perform operation on them, and to convert them between different formats. An example of its usage can be seen in the create function of "PostController.php".
