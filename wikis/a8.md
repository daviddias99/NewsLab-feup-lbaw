# A8: Vertical prototype (Collaborative News)

Our product is called NewsLab. It consists of a collaborative news web application where anyone has the freedom to write and develop news about various topics and read about occurrences all around the world, serving as a platform not only to increase each one's awareness and knowledge about the world but also as a way to unite people and increase communication. It will be designed to create an all-encompassing place where people can write and discuss news in a collaborative manner, centralizing news and perspectives from all over the world allowing users to create a wholesome outlook on whatever subject they like.

The goal of this artifact is to provide a general description of the architecture that will be used for the development of the system. As such we provide an implementation of some high-priority user stories that showcase creation, fetching, update and deletion operations as well as authentication features. This demonstrates the process we'll utilize to interface with the database (through Eloquent), generate pages and execute requests.
