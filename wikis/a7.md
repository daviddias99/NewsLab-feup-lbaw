(It seems like it does not even work properly if he is in control of his body.) He is also very fast, having killed many people in one night . (This may be due to his alcohol induced rage, and/or his ability to keep his balance when headbutting  someone.)\nUsually he is quite a nice  guy, but after getting inebriated he is prone to aggressive behavior, and will attack people he considers his enemy.\nHis last fight was against a guy called David, who he easily beat because of the height  difference between them. He was almost losing when he decided to do his go to move, which dropped his opponent immediately.\nThe first time he killed  someone was around 2 years ago when he took out his best friend because he said \"Hey, you are the only friend who is not going to make it!\" The best part is that he was right. He failed in  every other area. ( His brain was  not developed enough, and his head was all swollen due to the headbut ting.)\nThe best time to fight with him is when he is in calm, relaxed state, and will not attack you.\n",

(It seems like it does not even work properly if he is in control of his body.) He is also very fast, having killed many people in one night . (This may be due to his alcohol induced rage, and/or his ability to keep his balance when headbutting  someone.)\nUsually he is quite a nice  guy, but after getting inebriated he is prone to aggressive behavior, and will attack people he considers his enemy.\nHis last fight was against a guy called David, who he easily beat because of the height  difference between them. He was almost losing when he decided to do his go to move, which dropped his opponent immediately.\nThe first time he killed  someone was around 2 years ago when he took out his best friend because he said \"Hey, you are the only friend who is not going to make it!\" The best part is that he was right. He failed in  every other area. ( His brain was  not developed enough, and his head was all swollen due to the headbut ting.)\nThe best time to fight with him is when he is in calm, relaxed state, and will not attack you.\n",

        "body": "\nThe UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and has now entered an 11-month transition period.\nDuring this period the UK effectively remains in the EU s customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules.\nHowever, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament.\nFuture trade deal\nThe first priority will be to negotiate a trade deal with the EU. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU.\nBut the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.\nTime is short. The EU could take weeks to agree a formal negotiating mandate - all the remaining 27 member states and the European Parliament have to be in agreement. That means formal talks might only begin in March.\nThe government has ruled out any form of extension to the transition period.\nIf no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU.\nThe prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that will make negotiations more difficult.\nIt is not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed.\n",

An outbreak of the highly contagious coronavirus has reached the US Pacific Northwest, according to US health officials. The outbreak began in the San Diego area of California, and has since spread to other parts of the state. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ) said that more than 400 confirmed cases had been confirmed in the region. According to Reuters, the most severe case is a woman who is in her 80s who recently contracted the virus while travelling to China . The virus has so far only killed two people , who died  from the respiratory infection. There is no known cure for the virus, but the symptoms are typically similar to those of a flu: fever, cough, fatigue, headache, and sore throat. The virus is spread through direct contact with body fluids , such as saliva , sweat , or mucus , of someone who has been infected. There have been no reports of people catching the virus from  eating infected food, so there is no  risk of  getting the illness while eating out at restaurants or other public places. The most severe cases have resulted in death , but there have been no cases of young children infected with the virus. However, health officials are concerned that if people with compromised immune systems ( such as immunocompromised people or people with chronic lung disease, like asthma or COPD ) are exposed to  the virus, they may be more susceptible to complications such as severe pneumonia or death. More than 50 countries around the world have now reported more cases of corona. There is no vaccine or treatment  for the disease. However, a new treatment developed by scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris , has been  found to offer the best hope of preventing it: inactivation . Researchers have isolated a protein found in bats that can be used as an anti- corona vaccine.","likes_difference":100,"edited":false,"publication_date":"2020-04-28 03:38:09+00","modification_date":null,"num_comments":0,"author":{"id":6,"name":"Cunha Cunha","photo":"ee6430845ce63b3519ac09a40de7e56955113f31b97b9836e0f6a04631479258.png"},"visible":true,"tags":[{"name":"health","id":1,"color":"#67aeca"},{"name":"science","id":9,"color":"#007761"}]}],"paginator":{"current_page":1,"data":[{"content_id":1,"title":"Corona Hits the US Pacific Northwest","publication_date":"2020-04-28 03:38:09+00","modification_date":null,"visible":true,"type":"News","photo":"6792bcbc00390b5a464c15e8118bcf51ec1c664792e82321c21d83f4b6a6f4e8.png","search":"'400':66B '50':261B '80s':89B 'a':83B,131B,283B,310B 'according':28B,75B 'an':15B,320B 'and':43B,59B,137B 'anti':321B 'are':125B,218B,241B 'area':40B 'around':263B 'as':151B,228B,254B,319B 'asthma':238B 'at':188B,289B 'bats':314B 'be':248B,317B 'been':70B,160B,164B,205B,296B 'began':35B 'best':301B 'body':148B 'but':122B,202B 'by':287B 'california':42B 'can':316B 'case':81B 'cases':68B,197B,207B,270B 'catching':169B 'cdc':61B 'centers':55B 'children':210B 'china':98B 'chronic':234B 'complications':252B 'compromised':224B 'concerned':219B 'confirmed':67B,71B 'contact':146B 'contagious':20B 'contracted':92B 'control':58B 'copd':240B 'corona':1A,8B,272B,322B 'coronavirus':21B 'cough':134B 'countries':262B 'cunha':324,325 'cure':118B 'death':201B,258B 'developed':286B 'died':109B 'diego':39B 'direct':145B 'disease':57B,236B,281B 'eating':173B,186B 'exposed':242B 'far':103B 'fatigue':135B 'fever':133B 'flu':132B 'fluids':149B 'food':175B 'for':56B,119B,279B 'found':297B,312B 'from':110B,172B 'getting':182B 'had':69B 'has':22B,44B,101B,159B,295B 'have':163B,198B,204B,266B,308B 'headache':136B 'health':31B,216B 'her':88B 'highly':19B 'hits':2A,10B 'hope':302B 'however':215B,282B 'if':221B 'illness':184B 'immune':225B 'immunocompromised':229B 'in':36B,72B,87B,200B,293B,313B 'inactivation':306B 'infected':161B,174B,211B 'infection':113B 'institute':292B 'is':82B,86B,115B,142B,178B,274B 'isolated':309B 'it':305B 'killed':105B 'known':117B 'like':237B 'lung':235B 'may':247B 'more':64B,249B,259B,269B 'most':79B,195B 'mucus':155B 'new':7B,284B 'no':116B,165B,179B,206B,275B 'northwest':6A,14B,27B 'now':267B 'of':17B,41B,50B,130B,156B,167B,181B,208B,271B,303B 'offer':299B 'officials':32B,217B 'only':104B 'or':154B,190B,231B,239B,257B,277B 'other':48B,191B 'out':187B 'outbreak':9B,16B,34B 'pacific':5A,13B,26B 'paris':294B 'parts':49B 'pasteur':291B 'people':107B,168B,222B,230B,232B 'places':193B 'pneumonia':256B 'preventing':304B 'prevention':60B 'protein':311B 'public':192B 'reached':23B 'recently':91B 'region':74B 'reported':268B 'reports':166B 'researchers':307B 'respiratory':112B 'restaurants':189B 'resulted':199B 'reuters':77B 'risk':180B 'said':62B 'saliva':152B 'san':38B 'scientists':288B 'severe':80B,196B,255B 'similar':127B 'since':45B 'so':102B,176B 'someone':157B 'sore':138B 'spread':46B,143B 'state':52B 'such':150B,227B,253B 'susceptible':250B 'sweat':153B 'symptoms':124B 'systems':226B 'than':65B,260B 'that':63B,220B,315B 'the':3A,11B,18B,24B,33B,37B,51B,53B,73B,78B,93B,99B,111B,120B,123B,140B,170B,183B,194B,213B,244B,264B,280B,290B,300B 'there':114B,162B,177B,203B,273B 'they':246B 'those':129B 'throat':139B 'through':144B 'to':29B,47B,76B,97B,128B,243B,251B,298B 'travelling':96B 'treatment':278B,285B 'two':106B 'typically':126B 'us':4A,12B,25B,30B,54B 'used':318B 'vaccine':276B,323B 'virus':94B,100B,121B,141B,171B,214B,245B 'while':95B,185B 'who':85B,90B,108B,158B 'with':147B,212B,223B,233B 'woman':84B 'world':265B 'young':209B","pivot":{"user_id":8,"post_id":1},"content":{"id":1,"body":"New corona outbreak hits the US Pacific Northwest!!

So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament.\nFuture trade deal\nThe first priority will be to negotiate a trade deal with the EU. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU.\nBut the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.\nTime is short. The EU could take weeks to agree a formal negotiating mandate - all the remaining 27 member states and the European Parliament have to be in agreement. That means formal talks might only begin in March.\nThe government has ruled out any form of extension to the transition period.\nIf no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU.\nThe prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that will make negotiations more difficult.\nIt is not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed.\n",

(This may be due to his alcohol induced rage, and/or his ability to keep his balance when headbutting  someone.)\nUsually he is quite a nice  guy, but after getting inebriated he is prone to aggressive behavior, and will attack people he considers his enemy.\nHis last fight was against a guy called David, who he easily beat because of the height  difference between them. He was almost losing when he decided to do his go to move, which dropped his opponent immediately.\nThe first time he killed  someone was around 2 years ago when he took out his best friend because he said \"Hey, you are the only friend who is not going to make it!\" The best part is that he was right. He failed in  every other area. ( His brain was  not developed enough, and his head was all swollen due to the headbut ting.)\nThe best time to fight with him is when he is in calm, relaxed state, and will not attack you.\n",

                "body": "New corona outbreak hits the US Pacific Northwest!! An outbreak of the highly contagious coronavirus has reached the US Pacific Northwest, according to US health officials. The outbreak began in the San Diego area of California, and has since spread to other parts of the state. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ) said that more than 400 confirmed cases had been confirmed in the region. According to Reuters, the most severe case is a woman who is in her 80s who recently contracted the virus while travelling to China . The virus has so far only killed two people , who died  from the respiratory infection. There is no known cure for the virus, but the symptoms are typically similar to those of a flu: fever, cough, fatigue, headache, and sore throat. The virus is spread through direct contact with body fluids , such as saliva , sweat , or mucus , of someone who has been infected. There have been no reports of people catching the virus from  eating infected food, so there is no  risk of  getting the illness while eating out at restaurants or other public places. The most severe cases have resulted in death , but there have been no cases of young children infected with the virus. However, health officials are concerned that if people with compromised immune systems ( such as immunocompromised people or people with chronic lung disease, like asthma or COPD ) are exposed to  the virus, they may be more susceptible to complications such as severe pneumonia or death. More than 50 countries around the world have now reported more cases of corona. There is no vaccine or treatment  for the disease. However, a new treatment developed by scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris , has been  found to offer the best hope of preventing it: inactivation . Researchers have isolated a protein found in bats that can be used as an anti- corona vaccine.",

Nunca é demais lembrar o peso e o significado destes problemas, uma vez que o fenômeno da Internet não pode mais se dissociar das regras de conduta normativas. Caros amigos, o julgamento imparcial das eventualidades exige a precisão e a definição das formas de ação. A prática cotidiana prova que a necessidade de renovação processual nos obriga à análise do sistema de participação geral. Neste sentido, o desafiador cenário globalizado ainda não demonstrou convincentemente que vai participar na mudança dos modos de operação convencionais.\nNo entanto, não podemos esquecer que o aumento do diálogo entre os diferentes setores produtivos facilita a criação dos relacionamentos verticais entre as hierarquias. Desta maneira, a contínua expansão de nossa atividade acarreta um processo de reformulação e modernização do sistema de formação de quadros que corresponde às necessidades. Percebemos, cada vez mais, que a expansão dos mercados mundiais obstaculiza a apreciação da importância do processo de comunicação como um todo. Acima de tudo, é fundamental ressaltar que a consulta aos diversos militantes auxilia a preparação e a composição dos índices pretendidos. Assim mesmo, o início da atividade geral de formação de atitudes maximiza as possibilidades por conta da gestão inovadora da qual fazemos parte.\"\nYeah trully gibberish.

                "body": "\nWhether it’s fighting the belief that all gamers are antisocial weirdos or advocating for more inclusiveness in the medium’s protagonists, we here at OGN have always been dedicated to telling the truth about games. That is why we have undertaken a historic and undoubtedly forbidden investigation into one of the most common misconceptions about gaming: The idea that they make gamers more prone to violence. To do that, we adopted a young infant from a local orphanage, locked him inside of a cabin in the woods, and exposed him to nothing but violent video games for the past 12 years. The end result? It turns out critics are dead wrong. The child didn’t turn out violent at all, even though we have to admit he became an extremely weird individual.\nWe’re calling it now: Any naysayers out there who have painted games as the source of society’s violence need to admit their mistake, because while there’s definitely something off with this kid, it has nothing to do with violence.\nThe boy—whom we named “Sonic” after the titular hedgehog and because that is the one word he ever learned to speak—has never once attacked or even threatened another human being. In fact, he seems mostly content to just continue playing the games that have constituted his entire life since he first developed object permanence. That being said, Sonic can mostly only speak in gibberish sentences, and even a small amount of eye contact often ends with him foaming at the mouth and hiding in a closet for hours. But still, no violence.\nTo create a perfectly controlled environment for our experiment, young Sonic has been kept in a windowless room for his entire life. For years, he’s been fed nothing but mashed bananas and oatmeal and has never been allowed contact with any humans other than our one OGN researcher. In fact, to ensure he has a constant view of a violent video game, Sonic hasn’t even seen daylight in his decade on this earth. In this perfectly controlled environment, he has been either playing or watching some of the goriest and most bloody games ever produced from Mortal Kombat and the Postal series to Manhunt and Gears Of War.\nThen came the long-awaited culmination to the experiment. Last month, we brought Sonic out of his locked habitat and into the OGN offices, where we enrolled him a local public school. What proved incredible to both us—and any detractors of the gaming medium—is that he has not shown a single impulse to harm another living thing. Even when he has been bullied for his name or translucent skin and feral appearance, he has never lashed out, instead electing to press his hands against his ears and shake his head wildly or run out of the room in this strange, toddling walk that’s almost akin to a penguin.\n",

The “wolves” being other dads who would become enamored with her hypnotic beauty.\nMy friends were not being hyperbolic. Leonardo would have wept over Gizelle’s perfect hip-to-waist ratio and porcelain skin. Her hair, the color of softly churned butter, fell in long plaits to her hips. At five feet nine inches, she towered over my kids with legs and arms that seemed to multiply like Shiva’s limbs.\nEver try on one of those flowy, bohemian dresses and think — I look like a circus tent. Who the hell would this look good on? The answer is Gizelle.\nThe first week she was with us, I put her perfectly sculpted, baby giraffe thighs to work. I made her accompany me when making heavy purchases. Not to help lift things. Oh no. While in the past, I had to lug the potted rubber tree plant to the car on my own, I suddenly had three able-bodied gentlemen rolling up their sleeves with a “Can I help you with that ma’am?” (Men oddly always called me “ma’am” in Gizelle’s presence.)\nIf we went grocery shopping together, random male employees would stop to ask us if we had found everything we were looking for. Then with beads of perspiration forming at their temples and the whiff of pheromones gone awry, I would have to crush their hopes with, “No, I think we can find the peaches without your help.”\nShe was like some mystical Snow White, making the male forest creatures bow before her. I would watch her long, golden hair swoosh around her Botticelli hips and wonder — what would it be like to be that beautiful?\nThen the second thought would always follow…why was Gizelle so damn unhappy all the time?\n",

                "body": "\nIn their many (justified) laments about the trajectory of their profession in the digital age, songwriters and musicians regularly assert that music has been “devalued.” Over the years they’ve pointed at two outstanding culprits. First, it was music piracy and the futility of “competing with free.” More recently the focus has been on the seemingly miniscule payments songs generate when they’re streamed on services such as Spotify or Apple Music.\nThese are serious issues, and many agree that the industry and lawmakers have a lot of work to do. But at least there is dialogue and progress being made toward new models for rights and royalties in the new music economy.\nLess obvious are a number of other forces and trends that have devalued music in a more pernicious way than the problems of hyper-supply and inter-industry jockeying. And by music I don’t mean the popular song formats that one sees on awards shows and hears on commercial radio. I mean music the sonic art form — imaginative, conceptual composition and improvisation rooted in harmonic and rhythmic ideas. In other words, music as it was defined and regarded four or five decades ago, when art music (incompletely but generally called “classical” and “jazz”) had a seat at the table.\nWhen I hear songwriters of radio hits decry their tiny checks from Spotify, I think of today’s jazz prodigies who won’t have a shot at even a fraction of the old guard’s popular success. They can’t even imagine working in a music environment that might lead them to household name status of the Miles Davis or John Coltrane variety. They are struggling against forces at the very nexus of commerce, culture and education that have conspired to make music less meaningful to the public at large. Here are some of the most problematic issues musicians are facing in the industry’s current landscape.",

His body’s leukemic blast cell counts were doubling daily. Bone marrow was no longer making red or white blood cells, not even platelets. The marrow was only churning out cancer cells. In a process similar to churning butter, his blood was thickening with homogenous, malicious content: cancer. And like churning butter, it was exhausting work. The battered remnants of his healthy self were beaten down by chemo. And yet, every fiber pressed on.\nHe was so very tired. You could see it in his eyes. At the same time, you could see his love. His love for life was front and center. His love for sweetness crystalized on his tongue in the taste of sun-soaked strawberries. His love for satisfaction could be heard in the snapping sound of a puzzle piece set in place. His love for the simple, soothing smells of lavender emanating from a medicine ball was cherished, as was the fact that he could still hold a ball in his hands. He loved life down to the core, as only an eight-year-old can, and he was doing everything he could to stay alive.\nDeath was easy to detect. It was right under our eyes, sending the simplest of signals. No appetite. Breathing strained. Cold hands and feet, meaning compromised blood flow. Ankles swollen. Standing up was becoming nearly impossible. His body was shutting down. But it was his temperature that told us the landslide of disease was accelerating and about to swallow us whole.\nAt 3 p.m. on a Monday afternoon, his temperature was 107.2 degrees.\n",

                "body": "\nI’ve been using Twitter since 2012, I have seen the product evolve and I can say that I have grown with the product and the company. In my earlier years, Twitter was merely a product to me but it has become way more than that now — it has become part of me and my daily routine. Now, there are a million reasons you can give for that — the nice interface, cooler features, my lack of friends and a life — but I think a major reason why the product has stuck is because I have been able to build an emotional connection with it. I personally think my connection with the product can be partly attributed to the simple and intuitive microinteractions on the platform. Interactions like; favouriting a post, changing the favourite interaction from the star icon to the heart icon, the pull to refresh interaction, and all the other invisible interactions are what keeps the platform interesting, and that’s because of how much they all mimic real world interactions and conversations.\nProducts and interactions like this, (alongside my amazing colleague, Torian) inspired me to spend time understanding the intersection between microinteractions and emotional design, and how we can leverage microinteractions in creating experiences that stand as an extension of the physical world. Microinteractions are seemingly small alluring moments built into an experience that has a huge impact on the overall experience of users. Dan Saffer, who in my opinion is the father of modern microinteractions theory, defined microinteractions as contained product moments that revolve around a single use case and have one main task. A good example of a microinteraction would be; liking a post on Facebook or Instagram, or favouriting a post on Twitter, or even picking a password and setting an alarm.\nMicrointeractions in my opinion is a cool way for us to replicate the physical model of body language (gestures, facial expressions, haptics and physical movements) in our digital systems. According to the 7% rule, 93% of a conversation is nonverbal — 55% being body language and the other 38% is the tone of voice (which represents writing style and the information structure). I believe the same holds for product design, so 93% of the “conversation” is not based on components and copy, it’s based on the interaction design, with the focus being on how users communicate with products and how the product communicates with the user. This means we need to start thinking beyond visceral emotional design and seek out opportunities for behavioural and reflective emotional design.\nI think conversations around replicating physical communication in digital systems is heavily understated, particularly because we tend to forget that communication is not just talking to someone, it’s a continuous loop of listening, processing and giving feedback. In the design of digital products, we need to start thinking about interaction design in the same guise, and start asking ourselves questions related to the interaction of users with our product and vice versa. Doing this will result in more humane designs, which is where I believe emotional design theory comes into play. The way I see it, “we need to design interactions and microinteractions in a way that prevents humans from switching modes (modes being context and mental models), in a natural way that replicates the physical model of body language.” Users not having to switch modes and things working the way they expect them to are key tenets of behavioural emotional design, this means that there is opportunity for us to use microinteractions to implement behavioural emotional design.\nI intentionally used the word “humans” in the previous statement because sometimes, we focus so much on designing for users and customers that we forget to design for their humanity. The way I see things, our users and customers are first humans, then users or customers. So this is a push for designers to go a level deeper, for us to go past user-centricity to human-centricity, which is where reflective emotional design theory comes into play. Whether we choose to acknowledge it or not, our product/services evoke certain emotions in people. Most products choose to ignore this fact and focus rather on creating aesthetically pleasing interfaces, but I am of the opinion that they are missing out on a big opportunity to create a personal connection with their users. Focusing on forming a personal bond with the customers may not have a tangible short run benefit but in the long run, it makes your product sticky and initiates customer loyalty which has long term benefits on revenue, customer satisfaction and overall business outlook.\n",

So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament.\nFuture trade deal\nThe first priority will be to negotiate a trade deal with the EU. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU.\nBut the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.\nTime is short. The EU could take weeks to agree a formal negotiating mandate - all the remaining 27 member states and the European Parliament have to be in agreement. That means formal talks might only begin in March.\nThe government has ruled out any form of extension to the transition period.\nIf no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU.\nThe prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that will make negotiations more difficult.\nIt is not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed.\n",

            "body": "\nIn May of 2019, I was accepted to the Eli Whitney student program at Yale University. At 52, I am the oldest freshman in the class of 2023. Before I was accepted, I didn’t really know what to expect. I had seen the infamous YouTube video of students screaming at a faculty member. I had seen the news stories regarding the admissions scandal and that Yale was included in that unfortunate business. I had also heard the students at Yale referred to as “snowflakes” in various social media dumpsters and occasionally I’d seen references to Ivy League students as snowflakes in a few news sources.\nI should give a bit of background information. I was an unimpressive and difficult student in public schools. I joined the military at 17 and spent close to 26 years in the US Navy. I was assigned for 22 of those years to Naval Special Warfare Commands. I went through SEAL training twice, quit the first time and barely made it the second time. I did multiple deployments and was wounded in combat in 2009 on a mission to rescue an American hostage.\nEvery single day I went to work with much better humans than myself. I was brought to a higher level of existence because the standards were high and one needed to earn their slot, their membership in the unit. This wasn’t a one-time deal. Every time you showed up for work, you needed to prove your worth.\nThe vetting process is difficult and the percentage of those who try out for special operations units and make it through the screening is very low.\nIn an odd parallel, I feel, in spite of my short time here, the same about Yale.\nAfter receiving my acceptance email and returning to consciousness, I decided to move to Connecticut and do my best in this new environment. Many people have asked me why I want to attend college at 52, and why at an Ivy League institution like Yale? I could have easily stayed in Virginia and attended a community college close to my home. Well, based on my upbringing in the military, I associated a difficult vetting process with quality and opportunity. I was correct in that guess. More importantly, I simply want to be a better human being. I feel like getting a world-class education at an amazing institution like Yale will help me reach that goal. Are there other places to get a great education? Of course, but I chose Yale.\n",

So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament.\nFuture trade deal\nThe first priority will be to negotiate a trade deal with the EU. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU.\nBut the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.\nTime is short. The EU could take weeks to agree a formal negotiating mandate - all the remaining 27 member states and the European Parliament have to be in agreement. That means formal talks might only begin in March.\nThe government has ruled out any form of extension to the transition period.\nIf no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU.\nThe prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that will make negotiations more difficult.\nIt is not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed.\n",

(This may be due to his alcohol induced rage, and/or his ability to keep his balance when headbutting  someone.)\nUsually he is quite a nice  guy, but after getting inebriated he is prone to aggressive behavior, and will attack people he considers his enemy.\nHis last fight was against a guy called David, who he easily beat because of the height  difference between them. He was almost losing when he decided to do his go to move, which dropped his opponent immediately.\nThe first time he killed  someone was around 2 years ago when he took out his best friend because he said \"Hey, you are the only friend who is not going to make it!\" The best part is that he was right. He failed in  every other area. ( His brain was  not developed enough, and his head was all swollen due to the headbut ting.)\nThe best time to fight with him is when he is in calm, relaxed state, and will not attack you.\n",

            "body": "New corona outbreak hits the US Pacific Northwest!! An outbreak of the highly contagious coronavirus has reached the US Pacific Northwest, according to US health officials. The outbreak began in the San Diego area of California, and has since spread to other parts of the state. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ) said that more than 400 confirmed cases had been confirmed in the region. According to Reuters, the most severe case is a woman who is in her 80s who recently contracted the virus while travelling to China . The virus has so far only killed two people , who died  from the respiratory infection. There is no known cure for the virus, but the symptoms are typically similar to those of a flu: fever, cough, fatigue, headache, and sore throat. The virus is spread through direct contact with body fluids , such as saliva , sweat , or mucus , of someone who has been infected. There have been no reports of people catching the virus from  eating infected food, so there is no  risk of  getting the illness while eating out at restaurants or other public places. The most severe cases have resulted in death , but there have been no cases of young children infected with the virus. However, health officials are concerned that if people with compromised immune systems ( such as immunocompromised people or people with chronic lung disease, like asthma or COPD ) are exposed to  the virus, they may be more susceptible to complications such as severe pneumonia or death. More than 50 countries around the world have now reported more cases of corona. There is no vaccine or treatment  for the disease. However, a new treatment developed by scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris , has been  found to offer the best hope of preventing it: inactivation . Researchers have isolated a protein found in bats that can be used as an anti- corona vaccine.",

He is already got a record deal with Sony Music and has worked with many other big artists including Justin Bieber and Jennifer Lopez. His upcoming record is set to be called \"El on Musk – The Story of Everything,\"   and it will include his take on the life and death of his late friend. \"In the end, it is my mission to tell the story of what it is like to love someone who is gone ,\"  says the Tesla CEO . \"As Ive said before: you can never have enough of anyone . \".  Musk s music video for his new song has already gone viral and has received over 8 million views on YouTube. A version of the song featuring Beyonce is also in the works. This is an interesting and unique way of  celebrating the passing of a good friend. For many of us, his passion, drive and ingenuity was what attracted us to Elon Musk. His ideas for the future of space travel, transportation and electric cars are incredible and have given us more reasons to believe in humanity. If you are  looking for some inspiration on how to say goodbye to someone you love, make sure to check out the video.",

Nunca é demais lembrar o peso e o significado destes problemas, uma vez que o fenômeno da Internet não pode mais se dissociar das regras de conduta normativas. Caros amigos, o julgamento imparcial das eventualidades exige a precisão e a definição das formas de ação. A prática cotidiana prova que a necessidade de renovação processual nos obriga à análise do sistema de participação geral. Neste sentido, o desafiador cenário globalizado ainda não demonstrou convincentemente que vai participar na mudança dos modos de operação convencionais.\nNo entanto, não podemos esquecer que o aumento do diálogo entre os diferentes setores produtivos facilita a criação dos relacionamentos verticais entre as hierarquias. Desta maneira, a contínua expansão de nossa atividade acarreta um processo de reformulação e modernização do sistema de formação de quadros que corresponde às necessidades. Percebemos, cada vez mais, que a expansão dos mercados mundiais obstaculiza a apreciação da importância do processo de comunicação como um todo. Acima de tudo, é fundamental ressaltar que a consulta aos diversos militantes auxilia a preparação e a composição dos índices pretendidos. Assim mesmo, o início da atividade geral de formação de atitudes maximiza as possibilidades por conta da gestão inovadora da qual fazemos parte.\"\nYeah trully gibberish.

Leonardo would have wept over Gizelle’s perfect hip-to-waist ratio and porcelain skin. Her hair, the color of softly churned butter, fell in long plaits to her hips. At five feet nine inches, she towered over my kids with legs and arms that seemed to multiply like Shiva’s limbs.\nEver try on one of those flowy, bohemian dresses and think — I look like a circus tent. Who the hell would this look good on? The answer is Gizelle.\nThe first week she was with us, I put her perfectly sculpted, baby giraffe thighs to work. I made her accompany me when making heavy purchases. Not to help lift things. Oh no. While in the past, I had to lug the potted rubber tree plant to the car on my own, I suddenly had three able-bodied gentlemen rolling up their sleeves with a “Can I help you with that ma’am?” (Men oddly always called me “ma’am” in Gizelle’s presence.)\nIf we went grocery shopping together, random male employees would stop to ask us if we had found everything we were looking for. Then with beads of perspiration forming at their temples and the whiff of pheromones gone awry, I would have to crush their hopes with, “No, I think we can find the peaches without your help.”\nShe was like some mystical Snow White, making the male forest creatures bow before her. I would watch her long, golden hair swoosh around her Botticelli hips and wonder — what would it be like to be that beautiful?\nThen the second thought would always follow…why was Gizelle so damn unhappy all the time?\n",

            "body": "\nIn their many (justified) laments about the trajectory of their profession in the digital age, songwriters and musicians regularly assert that music has been “devalued.” Over the years they’ve pointed at two outstanding culprits. First, it was music piracy and the futility of “competing with free.” More recently the focus has been on the seemingly miniscule payments songs generate when they’re streamed on services such as Spotify or Apple Music.\nThese are serious issues, and many agree that the industry and lawmakers have a lot of work to do. But at least there is dialogue and progress being made toward new models for rights and royalties in the new music economy.\nLess obvious are a number of other forces and trends that have devalued music in a more pernicious way than the problems of hyper-supply and inter-industry jockeying. And by music I don’t mean the popular song formats that one sees on awards shows and hears on commercial radio. I mean music the sonic art form — imaginative, conceptual composition and improvisation rooted in harmonic and rhythmic ideas. In other words, music as it was defined and regarded four or five decades ago, when art music (incompletely but generally called “classical” and “jazz”) had a seat at the table.\nWhen I hear songwriters of radio hits decry their tiny checks from Spotify, I think of today’s jazz prodigies who won’t have a shot at even a fraction of the old guard’s popular success. They can’t even imagine working in a music environment that might lead them to household name status of the Miles Davis or John Coltrane variety. They are struggling against forces at the very nexus of commerce, culture and education that have conspired to make music less meaningful to the public at large. Here are some of the most problematic issues musicians are facing in the industry’s current landscape.",

            "body": "\nSan Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick told reporters today that he will no longer kneel in protest during the anthem to raise awareness about police violence against people of color. And it’s all thanks to coming across one of your aunt’s posts on Facebook about the issue.\n“It had eight likes and three shares so it pretty much went viral and landed in my feed,” Kaepernick said of the post your aunt put up last night at 10:11 p.m. after she finished watching Designated Survivor. “She presented things in a way I had not considered before. For example, it turns out that regardless of what I say, I hate the troops. And her uncle served in the Coast Guard in the late ’70s so it really hits home for her. Also, she made it clear that because I make a lot of money, there is no reason for me to complain about anything and that I’m actually the racist one when you break it all down. So silence it is for me from here on out.”\nThe quarterback said he briefly considered commenting on your aunt’s post to thank her for her wisdom, but then remembered that she made the case that he should just “shut his mouth and be grateful.”\n“I don’t deserve to speak out like your aunt does,” said Kaepernick. “She is using her platform to say how she feels and that’s just how it is, even if I didn’t agree. It’s her right and everybody’s right to use what means they can to say what they think. It’s just not my right, unfortunately.”\nKaepernick said he also liked a post on your aunt’s page celebrating that it’s “Only one more day to Friday!”\n“You see, Fridays are fun because it’s the end of the standard work week,” said the quarterback. “Although a lot of people of color in this country and those born into poverty have to work nights and weekends because of systematic economic disparity in the United States. Oh, man. I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to say that. Please forgive me.”\n",

            "body": "\nWhether it’s fighting the belief that all gamers are antisocial weirdos or advocating for more inclusiveness in the medium’s protagonists, we here at OGN have always been dedicated to telling the truth about games. That is why we have undertaken a historic and undoubtedly forbidden investigation into one of the most common misconceptions about gaming: The idea that they make gamers more prone to violence. To do that, we adopted a young infant from a local orphanage, locked him inside of a cabin in the woods, and exposed him to nothing but violent video games for the past 12 years. The end result? It turns out critics are dead wrong. The child didn’t turn out violent at all, even though we have to admit he became an extremely weird individual.\nWe’re calling it now: Any naysayers out there who have painted games as the source of society’s violence need to admit their mistake, because while there’s definitely something off with this kid, it has nothing to do with violence.\nThe boy—whom we named “Sonic” after the titular hedgehog and because that is the one word he ever learned to speak—has never once attacked or even threatened another human being. In fact, he seems mostly content to just continue playing the games that have constituted his entire life since he first developed object permanence. That being said, Sonic can mostly only speak in gibberish sentences, and even a small amount of eye contact often ends with him foaming at the mouth and hiding in a closet for hours. But still, no violence.\nTo create a perfectly controlled environment for our experiment, young Sonic has been kept in a windowless room for his entire life. For years, he’s been fed nothing but mashed bananas and oatmeal and has never been allowed contact with any humans other than our one OGN researcher. In fact, to ensure he has a constant view of a violent video game, Sonic hasn’t even seen daylight in his decade on this earth. In this perfectly controlled environment, he has been either playing or watching some of the goriest and most bloody games ever produced from Mortal Kombat and the Postal series to Manhunt and Gears Of War.\nThen came the long-awaited culmination to the experiment. Last month, we brought Sonic out of his locked habitat and into the OGN offices, where we enrolled him a local public school. What proved incredible to both us—and any detractors of the gaming medium—is that he has not shown a single impulse to harm another living thing. Even when he has been bullied for his name or translucent skin and feral appearance, he has never lashed out, instead electing to press his hands against his ears and shake his head wildly or run out of the room in this strange, toddling walk that’s almost akin to a penguin.\n",

Such measures, necessary though they are, have crippled the economy at every level, from corporate to small business to individual.\nRecognizing the moral imperative of the moment, Congress has proposed a $1.8 trillion economic stabilization package to aid families and businesses affected by the pandemic. (That’s nearly double the size of the expected federal budget deficit this year, but market stabilization and Americans’ well-being takes precedence in a moment like this.)\nA bailout of this size and scope is unprecedented. Every industry is being devastated by the coronavirus. The American public and industries need immediate relief, and for the first time, voting in favor of a bailout will not cost an elected official their position. There are no conversations around deficit spending when the Las Vegas Strip is closed for business.\nUnlike businesses selling goods like clothing or food, barbers can’t transition their business to online commerce or takeout service; there are no unemployment benefits to apply for. A vanity service doesn’t immediately come to mind for a bailout — and it won’t without a representative convincing legislators of its worth.\n",

            "body": "\n“There was blood everywhere. But wait, let me backtrack.”\n“This piercing voice was screaming so loudly that I could hear her from the second floor. She lives on the fourth. I’m a nurse, so when I hear somebody screeching, “Heeeeelp! Heeeeelp!” I spring into action. I jolted out of my apartment and checked all the rooms on my floor. Then I sprinted up the stairs to the third floor. The screaming wasn’t coming from there either.\nI raced up to the fourth floor, and I heard it loud and clear. “Help! Help me right now!” I crept into apartment 4F and there was Marcy. Laying on the floor. Completely undressed. In a pool of blood. There was blood everywhere.”\nI caught up with my friend Lara not too long ago, and she showed up fully exasperated. She arrived at the gym (we were doing a workout together) already sweating, and even before giving me a hug, she held her pointer finger up and then keeled over and placed her hands on her knees. “Jordan, you’ll never believe what just happened to me.” She proceeded to describe the scene above.\nFortunately, this story has a happy ending. Marcy fell off of her bed and cut her knee. Yes, there was a lot of blood, but Lara cleaned her up, got her to the hospital, and the doctors stitched her and had her home within the next 24 hours. But that’s not everything. Lara mentioned how Marcy was so appreciative of her help that she invited her over for wine and pizza later that week.\nThe lessons shared below are from Lara’s conversation the night her and Marcy had wine and pizza together. A night that began at 7 pm and did not end until 3 in the morning.\nAfter standard pleasantries, deciding which bottle they were going to break out first, and from which pizza place they were going to order, Marcy got straight to the point.\n“Lara, I am 99-years old. I have no family, no friends, and I do not love my life.”\n“When I saw you come into my apartment the other day and you helped me for no apparent reason, I took that as a sign. You saw me at my worst. Naked. Cold. Alone. Afraid. I think when somebody sees us in our purest, most vulnerable state, there is an instant connection.”\n“I am not going to make many more connections during my time left here, but I think I can make at least one. Let’s take this night to connect. Let’s take this time to allow me to share with you my life and all that I have learned. I don’t know you, but I do know me. And I know it’s cliché, but I don’t want you to make the same mistakes I did. I want to share my mistakes, my regrets. So, tonight, we drink, we eat, and we talk about life.”\nLara simply smiled and filled their first glass with a Lambrusco, a sparkling red wine.\n",

            "body": "\nI’ve been using Twitter since 2012, I have seen the product evolve and I can say that I have grown with the product and the company. In my earlier years, Twitter was merely a product to me but it has become way more than that now — it has become part of me and my daily routine. Now, there are a million reasons you can give for that — the nice interface, cooler features, my lack of friends and a life — but I think a major reason why the product has stuck is because I have been able to build an emotional connection with it. I personally think my connection with the product can be partly attributed to the simple and intuitive microinteractions on the platform. Interactions like; favouriting a post, changing the favourite interaction from the star icon to the heart icon, the pull to refresh interaction, and all the other invisible interactions are what keeps the platform interesting, and that’s because of how much they all mimic real world interactions and conversations.\nProducts and interactions like this, (alongside my amazing colleague, Torian) inspired me to spend time understanding the intersection between microinteractions and emotional design, and how we can leverage microinteractions in creating experiences that stand as an extension of the physical world. Microinteractions are seemingly small alluring moments built into an experience that has a huge impact on the overall experience of users. Dan Saffer, who in my opinion is the father of modern microinteractions theory, defined microinteractions as contained product moments that revolve around a single use case and have one main task. A good example of a microinteraction would be; liking a post on Facebook or Instagram, or favouriting a post on Twitter, or even picking a password and setting an alarm.\nMicrointeractions in my opinion is a cool way for us to replicate the physical model of body language (gestures, facial expressions, haptics and physical movements) in our digital systems. According to the 7% rule, 93% of a conversation is nonverbal — 55% being body language and the other 38% is the tone of voice (which represents writing style and the information structure). I believe the same holds for product design, so 93% of the “conversation” is not based on components and copy, it’s based on the interaction design, with the focus being on how users communicate with products and how the product communicates with the user. This means we need to start thinking beyond visceral emotional design and seek out opportunities for behavioural and reflective emotional design.\nI think conversations around replicating physical communication in digital systems is heavily understated, particularly because we tend to forget that communication is not just talking to someone, it’s a continuous loop of listening, processing and giving feedback. In the design of digital products, we need to start thinking about interaction design in the same guise, and start asking ourselves questions related to the interaction of users with our product and vice versa. Doing this will result in more humane designs, which is where I believe emotional design theory comes into play. The way I see it, “we need to design interactions and microinteractions in a way that prevents humans from switching modes (modes being context and mental models), in a natural way that replicates the physical model of body language.” Users not having to switch modes and things working the way they expect them to are key tenets of behavioural emotional design, this means that there is opportunity for us to use microinteractions to implement behavioural emotional design.\nI intentionally used the word “humans” in the previous statement because sometimes, we focus so much on designing for users and customers that we forget to design for their humanity. The way I see things, our users and customers are first humans, then users or customers. So this is a push for designers to go a level deeper, for us to go past user-centricity to human-centricity, which is where reflective emotional design theory comes into play. Whether we choose to acknowledge it or not, our product/services evoke certain emotions in people. Most products choose to ignore this fact and focus rather on creating aesthetically pleasing interfaces, but I am of the opinion that they are missing out on a big opportunity to create a personal connection with their users. Focusing on forming a personal bond with the customers may not have a tangible short run benefit but in the long run, it makes your product sticky and initiates customer loyalty which has long term benefits on revenue, customer satisfaction and overall business outlook.\n",

Before I was accepted, I didn’t really know what to expect. I had seen the infamous YouTube video of students screaming at a faculty member. I had seen the news stories regarding the admissions scandal and that Yale was included in that unfortunate business. I had also heard the students at Yale referred to as “snowflakes” in various social media dumpsters and occasionally I’d seen references to Ivy League students as snowflakes in a few news sources.\nI should give a bit of background information. I was an unimpressive and difficult student in public schools. I joined the military at 17 and spent close to 26 years in the US Navy. I was assigned for 22 of those years to Naval Special Warfare Commands. I went through SEAL training twice, quit the first time and barely made it the second time. I did multiple deployments and was wounded in combat in 2009 on a mission to rescue an American hostage.\nEvery single day I went to work with much better humans than myself. I was brought to a higher level of existence because the standards were high and one needed to earn their slot, their membership in the unit. This wasn’t a one-time deal. Every time you showed up for work, you needed to prove your worth.\nThe vetting process is difficult and the percentage of those who try out for special operations units and make it through the screening is very low.\nIn an odd parallel, I feel, in spite of my short time here, the same about Yale.\nAfter receiving my acceptance email and returning to consciousness, I decided to move to Connecticut and do my best in this new environment. Many people have asked me why I want to attend college at 52, and why at an Ivy League institution like Yale? I could have easily stayed in Virginia and attended a community college close to my home. Well, based on my upbringing in the military, I associated a difficult vetting process with quality and opportunity. I was correct in that guess. More importantly, I simply want to be a better human being. I feel like getting a world-class education at an amazing institution like Yale will help me reach that goal. Are there other places to get a great education? Of course, but I chose Yale.\n",

He is already got a record deal with Sony Music and has worked with many other big artists including Justin Bieber and Jennifer Lopez. His upcoming record is set to be called \"El on Musk – The Story of Everything,\"   and it will include his take on the life and death of his late friend. \"In the end, it is my mission to tell the story of what it is like to love someone who is gone ,\"  says the Tesla CEO . \"As Ive said before: you can never have enough of anyone . \".  Musk s music video for his new song has already gone viral and has received over 8 million views on YouTube. A version of the song featuring Beyonce is also in the works. This is an interesting and unique way of  celebrating the passing of a good friend. For many of us, his passion, drive and ingenuity was what attracted us to Elon Musk. His ideas for the future of space travel, transportation and electric cars are incredible and have given us more reasons to believe in humanity. If you are  looking for some inspiration on how to say goodbye to someone you love, make sure to check out the video.",
