# A2: Actors and User stories (Collaborative News)


Our product is called NewsLab. It consists of a collaborative news web application where anyone has the freedom to write and develop news about various topics and read about occurrences all around the world, serving as a platform not only to increase each one's awareness and knowledge about the world but also as a way to unite people and increase communication. It will be designed to create an all-encompassing place where people can write and discuss news in a collaborative manner, centralizing news and perspectives from all over the world allowing users to create a wholesome outlook on whatever subject they like.



This artifact, containing the specification of the actors and user stories, serves as a description of the entities that interact with the system and the said interactions. Each actor's role is described and exemplified. The actor's interactions are presented in the form of user stories, well-described and prioritized, to support future development.
In the annex, non-functional requirements, such as business rules, technical requirements and restrictions, are specified.


## 1. Actors

|    BR09    |  Self-report          | A user can't report itself. |

|    BR15    | Default photos          | If a user or notification is not connected with a photo, they will have a default photo. The posts need to have a banner image. |
|    BR16    | Likes and dislikes of content          | The specific amount of likes and dislikes of a post or comment are only visible by admins, if that content is reported. In all other cases, only the like/dislike difference is visible. |
