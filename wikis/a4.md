# A4: Conceptual Data Model (Collaborative News)

Our product is called NewsLab. It consists of a collaborative news web application where anyone has the freedom to write and develop news about various topics and read about occurrences all around the world, serving as a platform not only to increase each one's awareness and knowledge about the world but also as a way to unite people and increase communication. It will be designed to create an all-encompassing place where people can write and discuss news in a collaborative manner, centralizing news and perspectives from all over the world allowing users to create a wholesome outlook on whatever subject they like.

The goal of this artifact is to provide a representation of the entities that constitute our system and of the relations between them. This representation is done using UML (Unified Modeling Language) to make it more accessible and readable, as it is a common language among engineers. The conceptual model presented is oriented towards the design of the database that will support the system.

## 1. Class diagram

The following image shows the UML diagrams representing the conceptual model of the database. It contains classes, that represent entities of the system, each having their own attributes, associations and constraints.
